07. The number of digit 1 present in the binary representation of 3 x 512 + 5 x 64 + 7 x 8 + 3 is 

Answer : (a) 9 

```
### SOLUTION
> Whenever such question arises, try to convert it to decimal form
> while checking the multiplication values its clear that 
>> 8^1 = 8
>> 8^2 = 64
>> 8^3 = 512
> Lets rewrite the given equation
> 3 x 512 + 5 x 64 + 7 x 8 + 3 = 3 x (8^3) + 5 x (8^2) + 7 x (8^1) + 3 x (8^0)
> From this we can understand that this is a OCtal number which is trying to convert to decimal
> Lets write down the octal number : (3573)8 = (011 101 111 011)2
> So total 9 1's are there in the binary

08. The number of 1s present in the binary representation of 4 x 4096 + 9 x 256 + 7 x 16 + 5 is 

Answer : (a) 8

```
### SOLUTION :
> - while checking the multiplication values its clear that 
>> - 16^1 = 16
>> - 16^2 = 256
>> - 16^3 = 4096
> - Lets rewrite the given equation
> - 4 x 4096 + 9 x 256 + 7 x 16 + 5 = 4 x (16^3) + 9 x (16^2) + 7 x (16^1) + 5 x (16^0)
> - From this we can understand that this is a Hexa Decimal number which is trying to convert to decimal
> - Lets write down the Hexa number : (4975)16 = (0100 1001 0111 0101)2
> - So total 8 1's are there in the binary
