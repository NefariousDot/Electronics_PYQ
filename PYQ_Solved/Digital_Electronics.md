07. The number of digit 1 present in the binary representation of 3 x 512 + 5 x 64 + 7 x 8 + 3 is 

Answer : (a) 9 

```
### SOLUTION
> - Whenever such question arises, try to convert it to decimal form
> - while checking the multiplication values its clear that 
>> - 8^1 = 8
>> - 8^2 = 64
>> - 8^3 = 512
> - Lets rewrite the given equation
> - 3 x 512 + 5 x 64 + 7 x 8 + 3 = 3 x (8^3) + 5 x (8^2) + 7 x (8^1) + 3 x (8^0)
> - From this we can understand that this is a OCtal number which is trying to convert to decimal
> - Lets write down the octal number : (3573)8 = (011 101 111 011)2
> - So total 9 1's are there in the binary
>

08. The number of 1s present in the binary representation of 4 x 4096 + 9 x 256 + 7 x 16 + 5 is 

Answer : (a) 8

```
### SOLUTION :
> - while checking the multiplication values its clear that 
>> - 16^1 = 16
>> - 16^2 = 256
>> - 16^3 = 4096
> - Lets rewrite the given equation
> - 4 x 4096 + 9 x 256 + 7 x 16 + 5 = 4 x (16^3) + 9 x (16^2) + 7 x (16^1) + 5 x (16^0)
> - From this we can understand that this is a Hexa Decimal number which is trying to convert to decimal
> - Lets write down the Hexa number : (4975)16 = (0100 1001 0111 0101)2
> - So total 8 1's are there in the binary

09. A particular number system having base B is given (âˆš41)B = (5)10 

Answer : (b) 6
```
### SOLUTION :
> - Squaring LHS and RHS to avoid the sqare root 
> - ie; (41)B = (25)10
> - Convert (41)B to decimal ==> 4 x (B^1) + 1 x (B^0) = 4B + 1
> - 4B + 1 = 25
> - 4B = 24
> - B = ^

``` 

10. The minimum decimal equivalent of the number 11C.0 is 

Answer : (b) 194 

```
### SOLUTION :
> - Here one thing to remember is that "Base is NOT Specified for the given NUmber"
> - Lets assume (11C.0)x
> - For a number system of Base/radix 'R', The distanct symbols will be 0 to (R-1)
> - So; In the given number is C hence the R should be > C (12)
> - Lets conver the number to decimal ; X^2 + X + 12
> - The minimum value for X has to be 13 to maintain the (R-1) formula
> - There fore; (13^2) + 13 + 12
> - 169 + 13 + 12 = 194

11. Given (135)x + (144)x = (323)x. What is the value of X 

Answer : (d) 6 

```
### SOLUTION :
> - Lets convert the numbers to decimal
> - {(x^2) + 3x + 5} + {(x^2) + 4x + 4} = { 3(x^2) + 2x + 3}
> - 2(x^2) + 7x + 9 = 3(x^2) + 2x + 3
> - (x^2) - 5x - 6 = 0 ---> sum -5 & product -6 
> - (x - 6)(x + 1) = 0
> - X = 6 or -1
> 


``` 

12. What is the base of the number system for the following operation to be correct (54)b / (4)b = (13)b 

Answer : (c) 8

```
### SOLUTION :
> - Lets convert the numbers to decimal
> - ( 5b + 4 ) / 4 = b + 3 
> - 5b + 4 = (b + 3)* 4
> - 5b + 4 = 4b + 12
> - b = 8
> 
> 


``` 

13. If (11X1Y)8 = (12C9)16, what is the value of X and Y 

Answer : (c) 3 and 1

```
### SOLUTION :
> - (12C9)16 = (0001 0010 1100 1001)12
> - Grouping the same into 3 bit to get the octal equivalent
> - (000 001 001 011 001 001)2
> - ( 0 1 1 3 1 1 )8
> - X = 3 and Y = 1
